# Paradise-Nursery-Shopping-Application
In this final project, you will create a shopping cart application for an online plant shop which offers a variety of house plants.

The Paradise Nursery shopping cart features will include:

A Landing page with a button linking to the product listing page
A navigation bar with links to the landing, product listing, and shopping cart pages
A card for each plant that showcases the different plants along with their images, name, description, cost and an Add to cart button.
A minimum of two sections describing the plants in that section. For example, "Aromatic Plants" and "Medicinal Plants".
A cart page which displays the products in the cart.
The cart should have a card for each type of plant in the cart. Each card should have the thumbnail, the unit cost, the cost for all of the plants of that type and buttons to increase and decrease the quantity along with Delete button.
A Continue Shopping and Checkout buttons
You will apply the knowledge and skills gained from the practice project to implement dynamic functionalities in the final project. Hence it is recommended to complete the practice project before attempting the final project. For example, features like displaying the cart quantity in the navbar icon and updating the total cost when the user changes the item quantity will be part of the final project.
